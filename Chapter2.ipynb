        "This chapter serves as an introduction to the fundamental role of differential equations in describing Earth science phenomena and lays the groundwork for using Python as a computational tool for their numerical solution. We begin by exploring why differential equations are so prevalent in geosciences, illustrating with examples such as cooling processes and radioactive decay. Subsequently, we introduce the Python programming language, covering basic syntax, essential data structures like lists, and the powerful libraries NumPy and Matplotlib, which are indispensable for scientific computing and visualization."
